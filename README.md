# Survey123ReportLabTool
This project takes a downloaded file geodatabase created through the Survey123 application and exports a summary of the survey data to a PDF for each user. It uses arcpy and reportlab modules (among others). It also creates a hyperlinked image from downloaded and converted attachment images from the file geodatabase.
